# 🎯 Goal - Natural Language to SQL LLM Application 🚀

This project demonstrates how to convert natural language queries into SQL using a Language Model (LLM). The workflow involves a prompt being processed through an LLM, which is then passed to Gemini Pro to generate a SQL query. This query is executed against a SQL database, returning the desired response.

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### 1. 🗄️ SQLite Database Setup
- **Task:** Create a SQLite database and insert some records using Python 🐍.
- **Objective:** This database will be used as the backend for executing SQL queries generated by the LLM.

### 2. 🤖 LLM Integration with Gemini Pro
- **Task:** Implement an application that connects a Language Model (e.g., Gemini Pro) to your SQL database.
- **Objective:** Convert natural language prompts into SQL queries and retrieve the corresponding data from the database.

### 3. 🌐 Create Your Own API
- **Task:** Build an API to interact with the LLM and database.
- **Tool:** Use [MakerSuite](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to generate your API key and deploy the application.

### 4. 🚀 Deployed Application
- **Task:** Deploy the application and make it accessible online.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Prompt:** The user inputs a natural language query.
2. **LLM Processing:** The query is processed by the LLM (Gemini Pro).
3. **SQL Generation:** Gemini Pro generates the corresponding SQL query.
4. **Database Query:** The SQL query is executed against the SQLite database.
5. **Response:** The query result is returned to the user.
